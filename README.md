# Project: Restaurant Page

This project is part of The Odin Project, a restaurant page made in JavaScript. I'm still kinda confused with webpack and npm but I'm planning on reviewing this lesson again. I think I did this project wrong but I did learned something while doing it. For now, I'll just keep on doing projects because this is the best way for me to get practice and to let the lesson stick more to my brain.
